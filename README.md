# ThisNonsenseMustStop 

Recently, I realized that everytime I recharged my modem, I used just 80 percent of my data. The remaining 20 percent was usually guzzled by background processes downloading and uploading content useless to me.

Thats why I had to make this application. The, app, titled " This Nonsense Must Stop", kills any process...any process at all... that tampers with my data in the background. 

You can add exceptions i.e. programs you dont want the app to close, and you can remove them when you want too.

The program, like all my other apps is completely free and open source and free of adverts (I hate that shit).  

It was implemented in C# (Just because I targeted windows machines and again, c# is kinda cool), so if you know the language, you download the code here, and do what you will mercifully with the code.

Thanks everyone. User response is gold..000000
